# Robot-Kinematics
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on a Robot Kinematics Dataset by Denavit-Hartenberg convention to predict the movement of the 6 arms of the robot and their respective position in the coordinate system.

**This Project answers the following questions:**

**1)** How are the joint values (q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6) generated for a robot? Can you explain how these values are determined?
**2)**How are the x, y, and z coordinates calculated based on the joint values of a robot? Can you explain the relationship between the joint values and the Cartesian coordinates?
**3)**Which joint variables (q1..q6) have a significant impact on the x, y, and z coordinates? Can you analyze their influence?
**4)**Can you show the relationship between joint values and the corresponding x, y, and z coordinates using scatter plots or visualizations?
**5)**Are there any unusual or extreme values in the joint variables or the corresponding x, y, and z coordinates? Do they indicate any interesting patterns or anomalies?
**6)** Regression Analysis
